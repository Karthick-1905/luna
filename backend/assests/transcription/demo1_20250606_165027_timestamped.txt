[00:00:12.300 - 00:00:12.660] Tanya Cushman Reviewer Reviewer's Name
[00:00:12.660 - 00:00:13.240] So in college,
[00:00:15.100 - 00:00:16.360] I was a government major,
[00:00:16.500 - 00:00:18.600] which means I had to write a lot of papers.
[00:00:19.200 - 00:00:20.860] Now, when a normal student writes a paper,
[00:00:20.920 - 00:00:22.480] they might spread the work out a little like this.
[00:00:23.580 - 00:00:24.140] So, you know,
[00:00:26.540 - 00:00:28.260] you get started maybe a little slowly,
[00:00:28.260 - 00:00:29.780] but you get enough done in the first week
[00:00:31.780 - 00:00:33.920] everything gets done and things stay civil.
[00:00:35.520 - 00:00:37.660] And I would want to do that like that.
[00:00:37.900 - 00:00:38.840] That would be the plan.
[00:00:39.060 - 00:00:41.760] I would have it all ready to go,
[00:00:41.900 - 00:00:44.220] but then actually the paper would come along,
[00:00:44.440 - 00:00:45.440] and then I would kind of do this.
[00:00:48.360 - 00:00:50.400] And that would happen every single paper.
[00:00:51.240 - 00:00:54.800] But then came my 90-page senior thesis,
[00:00:55.140 - 00:00:57.080] a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.
[00:00:57.740 - 00:00:58.880] And I knew for a paper like that,
[00:01:01.500 - 00:01:02.460] it was way too big a project.
[00:01:02.700 - 00:01:06.920] So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.
[00:01:07.540 - 00:01:08.640] This is how the year would go.
[00:01:08.880 - 00:01:10.200] So I'd start off light,
[00:01:11.020 - 00:01:12.780] and I'd bump it up in the middle months,
[00:01:13.380 - 00:01:16.140] and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear.
[00:01:16.300 - 00:01:17.140] It's like a little staircase.
[00:01:17.580 - 00:01:19.220] How hard can it be to just walk up the stairs?
[00:01:19.960 - 00:01:20.940] No big deal, right?
[00:01:22.840 - 00:01:24.640] But then, funniest thing happened.
[00:01:24.820 - 00:01:25.760] Those first few months,
[00:01:26.620 - 00:01:27.800] they came and went, and I couldn't do it.
[00:01:29.160 - 00:01:31.100] So we had an awesome, new revised plan.
[00:01:32.240 - 00:01:33.240] And then ...
[00:01:35.240 - 00:01:37.560] But then those middle months actually went by,
[00:01:38.160 - 00:01:40.120] and I didn't really write words.
[00:01:40.520 - 00:01:42.160] And so we were here.
[00:01:43.120 - 00:01:45.660] And then two months turned into one month,
[00:01:45.780 - 00:01:47.160] which turned into two weeks.
[00:01:47.520 - 00:01:48.800] And one day I woke up
[00:01:49.340 - 00:01:51.660] with three days until the deadline,
[00:01:53.060 - 00:01:54.900] still not having written a word.
[00:01:55.260 - 00:01:56.780] And so I did the only thing I could.
[00:01:57.260 - 00:02:00.000] I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,
[00:02:00.120 - 00:02:02.020] pulling not one but two all-nighters.
[00:02:02.240 - 00:02:04.480] Humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters.
[00:02:06.580 - 00:02:07.620] Sprinted across campus,
[00:02:08.080 - 00:02:09.360] dove in slow motion
[00:02:09.920 - 00:02:11.320] and got it in just at the deadline.
[00:02:11.700 - 00:02:13.100] I thought that was the end of everything.
[00:02:13.360 - 00:02:14.860] But a week later, I get a call.
[00:02:15.460 - 00:02:16.240] It's the school.
[00:02:17.440 - 00:02:19.120] And they say, is this Tim Urban?
[00:02:19.320 - 00:02:20.160] And I say, yeah.
[00:02:20.560 - 00:02:22.380] And they say, we need to talk about your thesis.
[00:02:22.780 - 00:02:23.720] And I say, OK.
[00:02:25.040 - 00:02:25.880] And they said,
[00:02:26.800 - 00:02:28.420] it's the best one we've ever seen.
[00:02:36.540 - 00:02:37.940] That did not happen.
[00:02:39.780 - 00:02:42.900] It was a very, very bad thesis.
[00:02:44.860 - 00:02:48.460] I just wanted to enjoy that one moment
[00:02:48.460 - 00:02:49.580] when all of you thought,
[00:02:49.680 - 00:02:50.780] this guy is amazing.
[00:02:52.380 - 00:02:53.940] No, no, it was very, very bad.
[00:02:55.580 - 00:02:58.240] Anyway, today, I'm a writer, blogger, guy.
[00:02:58.580 - 00:02:59.980] I write the blog Wait, But Why.
[00:03:00.360 - 00:03:03.800] And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
[00:03:04.060 - 00:03:07.320] My behaviors always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,
[00:03:07.400 - 00:03:10.280] and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world
[00:03:11.020 - 00:03:12.940] what goes on in the heads of procrastinators
[00:03:12.940 - 00:03:13.960] and why we are the way we are.
[00:03:14.140 - 00:03:17.620] Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators
[00:03:17.620 - 00:03:20.620] were actually different than the brains of other people.
[00:03:21.540 - 00:03:23.840] And to test this, I found an MRI lab
[00:03:25.980 - 00:03:28.360] and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,
[00:03:28.780 - 00:03:30.220] and so I could compare them.
[00:03:30.440 - 00:03:32.400] And I actually brought them here to show you today,
[00:03:32.580 - 00:03:35.140] and I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.
[00:03:35.280 - 00:03:37.120] And I know that if you're not a trained brain expert,
[00:03:37.220 - 00:03:39.640] it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?
[00:03:40.140 - 00:03:42.320] So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
[00:03:45.920 - 00:03:46.280] Now,
[00:03:48.280 - 00:03:49.320] here's my brain.
[00:03:55.260 - 00:03:56.700] There is a difference.
[00:03:57.580 - 00:04:00.320] Both brains have a rational decision-maker in them,
[00:04:00.380 - 00:04:04.600] but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant-gratification monkey.
[00:04:04.900 - 00:04:06.520] Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?
[00:04:06.660 - 00:04:09.440] Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.
[00:04:11.700 - 00:04:14.940] So the rational decision-maker will make the rational decision
[00:04:14.940 - 00:04:16.960] to do something productive,
[00:04:17.240 - 00:04:18.840] but the monkey doesn't like that plan.
[00:04:19.100 - 00:04:21.280] So he actually takes the wheel, and he says,
[00:04:21.280 - 00:04:21.640] Actually,
[00:04:23.820 - 00:04:25.720] of the Nancy Kerrigan-Tanya Harding scandal,
[00:04:25.840 - 00:04:27.280] because I just remembered that that happened.
[00:04:30.840 - 00:04:32.680] Then we're going to go over to the fridge
[00:04:32.680 - 00:04:34.760] and see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.
[00:04:35.580 - 00:04:39.060] After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral
[00:04:39.060 - 00:04:42.500] that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets
[00:04:42.500 - 00:04:43.840] and ends much, much later
[00:04:43.840 - 00:04:46.420] with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom.
[00:04:49.060 - 00:04:50.740] All of that's going to take a while,
[00:04:51.060 - 00:04:54.100] so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today, sorry.
[00:04:58.300 - 00:05:01.060] Now, what is going on here?
[00:05:03.240 - 00:05:04.880] The instant gratification monkey
[00:05:04.880 - 00:05:07.220] does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel.
[00:05:07.320 - 00:05:08.980] He lives entirely in the present moment,
[00:05:09.160 - 00:05:10.920] he has no memory of the past,
[00:05:11.180 - 00:05:12.360] no knowledge of the future,
[00:05:12.420 - 00:05:15.380] and he only cares about two things, easy and fun.
[00:05:16.100 - 00:05:19.020] Now, in the animal world, that works fine.
[00:05:19.320 - 00:05:19.880] If you're a dog,
[00:05:21.580 - 00:05:23.520] doing nothing other than easy and fun things,
[00:05:23.640 - 00:05:24.600] you're a huge success.
[00:05:26.640 - 00:05:28.000] And to the monkey,
[00:05:29.760 - 00:05:31.860] humans are just another animal species.
[00:05:32.040 - 00:05:33.660] He has to keep well-slept, well-fed,
[00:05:33.740 - 00:05:35.440] and propagating into the next generation,
[00:05:36.340 - 00:05:38.460] which in tribal times might have worked okay.
[00:05:38.740 - 00:05:41.440] But if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.
[00:05:41.600 - 00:05:43.300] We're in an advanced civilization,
[00:05:43.640 - 00:05:45.520] and the monkey does not know what that is,
[00:05:45.720 - 00:05:47.700] which is why we have another guy in our brain,
[00:05:47.700 - 00:05:48.600] the rational dog.
[00:05:52.080 - 00:05:53.540] no other animal can do.
[00:05:53.640 - 00:05:55.480] We can visualize the future.
[00:05:55.640 - 00:05:56.700] We can see the big picture.
[00:05:57.040 - 00:05:58.700] We can make long-term plans.
[00:05:58.860 - 00:06:00.700] And he wants to take all of that into account,
[00:06:01.740 - 00:06:06.340] and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now.
[00:06:06.640 - 00:06:10.260] Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun,
[00:06:10.360 - 00:06:12.200] like when you're having dinner or going to bed
[00:06:12.200 - 00:06:13.840] or enjoying well-earned leisure time.
[00:06:14.120 - 00:06:15.360] That's why there's an overlap.
[00:06:15.660 - 00:06:16.740] Sometimes they agree.
[00:06:17.340 - 00:06:17.980] But other times, they don't.
[00:06:20.440 - 00:06:23.780] to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant
[00:06:23.780 - 00:06:25.220] for the sake of the big picture,
[00:06:25.340 - 00:06:26.900] and that's when we have a conflict.
[00:06:27.660 - 00:06:29.040] And for the procrastinator,
[00:06:29.120 - 00:06:31.500] that conflict tends to end a certain way every time,
[00:06:31.700 - 00:06:34.660] leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,
[00:06:35.260 - 00:06:39.680] an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the make-sense circle.
[00:06:39.840 - 00:06:41.460] I call it the dark playground.
[00:06:44.980 - 00:06:46.980] Now, the dark playground is a place where you don't have to worry about
[00:06:49.180 - 00:06:49.940] know very well.
[00:06:50.540 - 00:06:52.440] It's where leisure activities happen
[00:06:52.440 - 00:06:55.460] at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.
[00:06:56.040 - 00:06:58.620] The fun you have in the dark playground isn't actually fun
[00:06:58.620 - 00:07:00.260] because it's completely unearned,
[00:07:00.260 - 00:07:03.820] and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred,
[00:07:03.860 - 00:07:05.500] all those good procrastinator feelings.
[00:07:06.280 - 00:07:09.600] And the question is, in this situation, with the monkey behind the wheel,
[00:07:09.840 - 00:07:13.260] how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,
[00:07:13.260 - 00:07:15.900] a less pleasant place, but where really important things
[00:07:17.200 - 00:07:21.900] Well, it turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel,
[00:07:22.080 - 00:07:24.880] someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him
[00:07:25.480 - 00:07:26.340] in his darkest moments,
[00:07:26.560 - 00:07:28.540] someone called the panic monster.
[00:07:34.580 - 00:07:38.380] Now, the panic monster is dormant most of the time,
[00:07:39.360 - 00:07:40.520] but he suddenly wakes up.
[00:07:40.760 - 00:07:43.040] Any time a deadline gets too close
[00:07:43.040 - 00:07:44.640] or there's danger of public embarrassment,
[00:07:47.700 - 00:07:51.720] And importantly, he's the only thing that the monkey is terrified of.
[00:07:51.920 - 00:07:55.700] Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,
[00:07:56.320 - 00:07:59.900] because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago
[00:07:59.900 - 00:08:01.420] and invited me to do a TED Talk.
[00:08:06.700 - 00:08:08.600] Now, of course, I said,
[00:08:08.660 - 00:08:12.400] yes, it's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
[00:08:23.880 - 00:08:27.080] but in the middle of all this excitement the rational decision maker seemed to have something
[00:08:27.080 - 00:08:33.540] else in his mind he was saying are we clear on what we just accepted do we do we get what's
[00:08:33.540 - 00:08:37.180] going to be now happening one day in the future we need to sit down and work on this right now
[00:08:37.180 - 00:08:41.660] and the monkey said totally agree but also let's just open google earth and let's zoom into the
[00:08:41.660 - 00:08:42.800] bottom of india like 200
[00:08:43.660 - 00:08:45.300] and we're going to scroll up for two and a half hours
[00:08:45.300 - 00:08:48.920] until we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for India.
[00:08:54.860 - 00:08:56.400] So that's what we did that day.
[00:09:00.420 - 00:09:04.200] As six months turned into four, and then two, and then one,
[00:09:04.340 - 00:09:07.200] the people of TED decided to release the speakers.
[00:09:07.420 - 00:09:08.760] And I opened up the website,
[00:09:09.020 - 00:09:11.360] and there was my face, staring right back at me,
[00:09:11.360 - 00:09:11.760] and
[00:09:17.080 - 00:09:19.480] So the panic monster starts losing his mind,
[00:09:19.680 - 00:09:22.060] and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.
[00:09:27.180 - 00:09:29.820] And the monkey, who, remember, he's terrified of the panic monster,
[00:09:29.900 - 00:09:30.900] boom, he's up the tree.
[00:09:31.500 - 00:09:33.120] And finally, finally,
[00:09:33.380 - 00:09:35.380] the rational decision-maker can take the wheel,
[00:09:35.460 - 00:09:36.880] and I can start working on the talk.
[00:09:36.880 - 00:09:40.780] Now, the panic monster explains all kinds of
[00:09:43.140 - 00:09:45.080] like how someone like me could spend two weeks
[00:09:45.080 - 00:09:48.560] unable to start the opening sentence of a paper,
[00:09:49.440 - 00:09:52.100] and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic
[00:09:52.100 - 00:09:54.760] to stay up all night and write eight pages.
[00:09:56.120 - 00:09:59.360] And this entire situation with the three characters,
[00:09:59.500 - 00:10:01.140] this is the procrastinator's system.
[00:10:01.700 - 00:10:04.920] It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
[00:10:05.240 - 00:10:07.960] And this is what I decided to write about on the blog
[00:10:08.480 - 00:10:09.280] just a couple years ago.
[00:10:09.280 - 00:10:09.980] Now, I want to talk to you about this.
[00:10:12.380 - 00:10:14.220] Literally thousands of emails came in
[00:10:14.220 - 00:10:16.960] from all different kinds of people from all over the world,
[00:10:16.980 - 00:10:18.280] doing all different kinds of things.
[00:10:18.660 - 00:10:22.100] These were people who were nurses and bankers and painters and engineers
[00:10:22.100 - 00:10:24.040] and lots and lots of PhD students.
[00:10:26.380 - 00:10:28.340] And they were all writing, saying the same thing.
[00:10:28.420 - 00:10:30.340] I have this problem, too.
[00:10:30.800 - 00:10:33.920] But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post
[00:10:34.480 - 00:10:36.060] and the heaviness of these emails.
[00:10:36.060 - 00:10:38.980] These people were writing about themselves.
[00:10:39.940 - 00:10:42.500] about what procrastination had done to their lives,
[00:10:42.700 - 00:10:44.660] about what this monkey had done to them.
[00:10:47.440 - 00:10:49.980] And I thought about this, and I said,
[00:10:50.040 - 00:10:52.480] if the procrastinator system works, then what's going on?
[00:10:52.720 - 00:10:54.480] Why are all these people in such a dark place?
[00:10:54.660 - 00:10:58.520] Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.
[00:10:59.760 - 00:11:01.780] Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,
[00:11:01.860 - 00:11:03.540] they all have deadlines, and when there's deadlines,
[00:11:03.740 - 00:11:07.680] the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term,
[00:11:07.680 - 00:11:07.980] because...
[00:11:09.400 - 00:11:11.140] But there's a second kind of procrastination
[00:11:11.140 - 00:11:14.260] that happens in situations when there is no deadline.
[00:11:14.560 - 00:11:16.940] So if you want to have a career where you want to be a self-starter,
[00:11:17.080 - 00:11:19.300] something in the arts, something entrepreneurial,
[00:11:19.600 - 00:11:21.480] there's no deadlines on those things at first
[00:11:22.000 - 00:11:23.300] because nothing's happening at first,
[00:11:23.360 - 00:11:25.180] not until you've gone out and done the hard work
[00:11:25.180 - 00:11:26.920] to get some momentum, to get things going.
[00:11:27.180 - 00:11:29.680] There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career
[00:11:29.680 - 00:11:31.220] that don't involve any deadlines,
[00:11:31.380 - 00:11:34.300] like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,
[00:11:34.300 - 00:11:36.980] working on your relationship or getting a job.
[00:11:39.220 - 00:11:42.220] Now, if the procrastinator's only mechanism
[00:11:42.840 - 00:11:45.640] of doing these hard things is the panic monster,
[00:11:45.700 - 00:11:48.100] that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations,
[00:11:48.980 - 00:11:51.760] the panic monster doesn't show up, he has nothing to wake up for,
[00:11:51.940 - 00:11:54.280] so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained,
[00:11:54.360 - 00:11:56.040] they just extend outward forever.
[00:11:57.560 - 00:11:59.980] And it's this long-term kind of procrastination
[00:12:00.520 - 00:12:03.640] that's much less visible and much less talked about
[00:12:03.640 - 00:12:05.980] than the funnier, short-term, deadline-based ones.
[00:12:06.600 - 00:12:09.100] It's usually suffered quietly and privately,
[00:12:10.460 - 00:12:14.860] and it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness and regrets.
[00:12:16.220 - 00:12:19.380] And I thought, that's why these people are emailing,
[00:12:19.400 - 00:12:21.200] and that's why they're in such a bad place.
[00:12:21.540 - 00:12:24.380] It's not that they're cramming for some project.
[00:12:24.660 - 00:12:27.840] It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,
[00:12:27.860 - 00:12:29.700] at times, in their own lives.
[00:12:30.440 - 00:12:33.380] The frustration was not that they couldn't achieve their dreams,
[00:12:33.380 - 00:12:34.440] it's that they weren't even able
[00:12:36.380 - 00:12:40.580] So I read these emails, and I had a little bit of an epiphany
[00:12:41.980 - 00:12:45.020] that I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
[00:12:45.680 - 00:12:48.660] That's right, I think all of you are procrastinators.
[00:12:49.540 - 00:12:52.620] Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us,
[00:12:54.340 - 00:12:57.300] and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines.
[00:12:57.700 - 00:13:02.120] But remember, the monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there.
[00:13:03.180 - 00:13:03.980] Now, I want to show you one example.
[00:13:04.880 - 00:13:07.280] I call this a life calendar.
[00:13:08.020 - 00:13:12.180] That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.
[00:13:13.060 - 00:13:14.600] That's not that many boxes,
[00:13:14.680 - 00:13:17.640] especially since we've already used a bunch of those.
[00:13:18.140 - 00:13:23.320] So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.
[00:13:24.480 - 00:13:27.620] And we need to think about what we're really procrastinating on,
[00:13:27.680 - 00:13:31.120] because everyone is procrastinating on something in life.
[00:13:31.120 - 00:13:32.980] We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on.
[00:13:37.120 - 00:13:39.500] That's a job for all of us.
[00:13:40.780 - 00:13:42.400] And because there's not that many boxes on there,
[00:13:42.460 - 00:13:44.600] it's a job that should probably start today.
[00:13:45.000 - 00:13:48.120] Well, maybe not today, but ...
[00:13:49.480 - 00:13:52.200] You know, sometime soon.
[00:13:53.020 - 00:13:53.860] Thank you.
[00:13:54.660 - 00:13:55.600] Thank you.
[00:14:01.000 - 00:14:02.980] Thank you.
