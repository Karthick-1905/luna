  "full_text": "Tanya Cushman Reviewer Reviewer's Name So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know, you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week everything gets done and things stay civil. And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then actually the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this. And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, it was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear. It's like a little staircase. How hard can it be to just walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, funniest thing happened. Those first few months, they came and went, and I couldn't do it. So we had an awesome, new revised plan. And then ... But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words. And so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word. And so I did the only thing I could. I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters. Humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters. Sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later, I get a call. It's the school. And they say, is this Tim Urban? And I say, yeah. And they say, we need to talk about your thesis. And I say, OK. And they said, it's the best one we've ever seen. That did not happen. It was a very, very bad thesis. I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, this guy is amazing. No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today, I'm a writer, blogger, guy. I write the blog Wait, But Why. And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behaviors always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, and so I could compare them. And I actually brought them here to show you today, and I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. And I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator. Now, here's my brain. There is a difference. Both brains have a rational decision-maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant-gratification monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. So the rational decision-maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like that plan. So he actually takes the wheel, and he says, Actually, of the Nancy Kerrigan-Tanya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened. Then we're going to go over to the fridge and see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today, sorry. Now, what is going on here? The instant gratification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment, he has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things, easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog, doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success. And to the monkey, humans are just another animal species. He has to keep well-slept, well-fed, and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked okay. But if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization, and the monkey does not know what that is, which is why we have another guy in our brain, the rational dog. no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account, and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, they don't. to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant for the sake of the big picture, and that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the make-sense circle. I call it the dark playground. Now, the dark playground is a place where you don't have to worry about know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the dark playground isn't actually fun because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred, all those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things Well, it turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments, someone called the panic monster. Now, the panic monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up. Any time a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, And importantly, he's the only thing that the monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. Now, of course, I said, yes, it's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past. but in the middle of all this excitement the rational decision maker seemed to have something else in his mind he was saying are we clear on what we just accepted do we do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future we need to sit down and work on this right now and the monkey said totally agree but also let's just open google earth and let's zoom into the bottom of india like 200 and we're going to scroll up for two and a half hours until we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for India. So that's what we did that day. As six months turned into four, and then two, and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face, staring right back at me, and So the panic monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem. And the monkey, who, remember, he's terrified of the panic monster, boom, he's up the tree. And finally, finally, the rational decision-maker can take the wheel, and I can start working on the talk. Now, the panic monster explains all kinds of like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation with the three characters, this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. And this is what I decided to write about on the blog just a couple years ago. Now, I want to talk to you about this. Literally thousands of emails came in from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These were people who were nurses and bankers and painters and engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. And they were all writing, saying the same thing. I have this problem, too. But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing about themselves. about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, if the procrastinator system works, then what's going on? Why are all these people in such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines, and when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term, because... But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you want to have a career where you want to be a self-starter, something in the arts, something entrepreneurial, there's no deadlines on those things at first because nothing's happening at first, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get some momentum, to get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting a job. Now, if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the panic monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the panic monster doesn't show up, he has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained, they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term, deadline-based ones. It's usually suffered quietly and privately, and it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness and regrets. And I thought, that's why these people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration was not that they couldn't achieve their dreams, it's that they weren't even able So I read these emails, and I had a little bit of an epiphany that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right, I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember, the monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now, I want to show you one example. I call this a life calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. And we need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but ... You know, sometime soon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

00:02:37.940] That did not happen.\n[00:02:39.780 - 00:02:42.900] It was a very, very bad thesis.\n[00:02:44.860 - 00:02:48.460] I just wanted to enjoy that one moment\n[00:02:48.460 - 00:02:49.580] when all of you thought,\n[00:02:49.680 - 00:02:50.780] this guy is amazing.\n[00:02:52.380 - 00:02:53.940] No, no, it was very, very bad.\n[00:02:55.580 - 00:02:58.240] Anyway, today, I'm a writer, blogger, guy.\n[00:02:58.580 - 00:02:59.980] I write the blog Wait, But Why.\n[00:03:00.360 - 00:03:03.800] And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.\n[00:03:04.060 - 00:03:07.320] My behaviors always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,\n[00:03:07.400 - 00:03:10.280] and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world\n[00:03:11.020 - 00:03:12.940] what goes on in the heads of procrastinators\n[00:03:12.940 - 00:03:13.960] and why we are the way we are.\n[00:03:14.140 - 00:03:17.620] Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators\n[00:03:17.620 - 00:03:20.620] were actually different than the brains of other people.\n[00:03:21.540 - 00:03:23.840] And to test this, I found an MRI lab\n[00:03:25.980 - 00:03:28.360] and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,\n[00:03:28.780 - 00:03:30.220] and so I could compare them.\n[00:03:30.440 - 00:03:32.400] And I actually brought them here to show you today,\n[00:03:32.580 - 00:03:35.140] and I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.\n[00:03:35.280 - 00:03:37.120] And I know that if you're not a trained brain expert,\n[00:03:37.220 - 00:03:39.640] it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?\n[00:03:40.140 - 00:03:42.320] So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.\n[00:03:45.920 - 00:03:46.280] Now,\n[00:03:48.280 - 00:03:49.320] here's my brain.\n[00:03:55.260 - 00:03:56.700] There is a difference.\n[00:03:57.580 - 00:04:00.320] Both brains have a rational decision-maker in them,\n[00:04:00.380 - 00:04:04.600] but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant-gratification monkey.\n[00:04:04.900 - 00:04:06.520] Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?\n[00:04:06.660 - 00:04:09.440] Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.\n[00:04:11.700 - 00:04:14.940] So the rational decision-maker will make the rational decision\n[00:04:14.940 - 00:04:16.960] to do something productive,\n[00:04:17.240 - 00:04:18.840] but the monkey doesn't like that plan.\n[00:04:19.100 - 00:04:21.280] So he actually takes the wheel, and he says,\n[00:04:21.280 - 00:04:21.640] Actually,\n[00:04:23.820 - 00:04:25.720] of the Nancy Kerrigan-Tanya Harding scandal,\n[00:04:25.840 - 00:04:27.280] because I just remembered that that happened.\n[00:04:30.840 - 00:04:32.680] Then we're going to go over to the fridge\n[00:04:32.680 - 00:04:34.760] and see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.\n[00:04:35.580 - 00:04:39.060] After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral\n[00:04:39.060 - 00:04:42.500] that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets\n[00:04:42.500 - 00:04:43.840] and ends much, much later\n[00:04:43.840 - 00:04:46.420] with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom.\n[00:04:49.060 - 00:04:50.740] All of that's going to take a while,\n[00:04:51.060 - 00:04:54.100] so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today, sorry.\n[00:04:58.300 - 00:05:01.060] Now, what is going on here?\n[00:05:03.240 - 00:05:04.880] The instant gratification monkey\n[00:05:04.880 - 00:05:07.220] does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel.\n[00:05:07.320 - 00:05:08.980] He lives entirely in the present moment,\n[00:05:09.160 - 00:05:10.920] he has no memory of the past,\n[00:05:11.180 - 00:05:12.360] no knowledge of the future,\n[00:05:12.420 - 00:05:15.380] and he only cares about two things, easy and fun.\n[00:05:16.100 - 00:05:19.020] Now, in the animal world, that works fine.\n[00:05:19.320 - 00:05:19.880] If you're a dog,\n[00:05:21.580 - 00:05:23.520] doing nothing other than easy and fun things,\n[00:05:23.640 - 00:05:24.600] you're a huge success.\n[00:05:26.640 - 00:05:28.000] And to the monkey,\n[00:05:29.760 - 00:05:31.860] humans are just another animal species.\n[00:05:32.040 - 00:05:33.660] He has to keep well-slept, well-fed,\n[00:05:33.740 - 00:05:35.440] and propagating into the next generation,\n[00:05:36.340 - 00:05:38.460] which in tribal times might have worked okay.\n[00:05:38.740 - 00:05:41.440] But if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.\n[00:05:41.600 - 00:05:43.300] We're in an advanced civilization,\n[00:05:43.640 - 00:05:45.520] and the monkey does not know what that is,\n[00:05:45.720 - 00:05:47.700] which is why we have another guy in our brain,\n[00:05:47.700 - 00:05:48.600] the rational dog.\n[00:05:52.080 - 00:05:53.540] no other animal can do.\n[00:05:53.640 - 00:05:55.480] We can visualize the future.\n[00:05:55.640 - 00:05:56.700] We can see the big picture.\n[00:05:57.040 - 00:05:58.700] We can make long-term plans.\n[00:05:58.860 - 00:06:00.700] And he wants to take all of that into account,\n[00:06:01.740 - 00:06:06.340] and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now.\n[00:06:06.640 - 00:06:10.260] Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun,\n[00:06:10.360 - 00:06:12.200] like when you're having dinner or going to bed\n[00:06:12.200 - 00:06:13.840] or enjoying well-earned leisure time.\n[00:06:14.120 - 00:06:15.360] That's why there's an overlap.\n[00:06:15.660 - 00:06:16.740] Sometimes they agree.\n[00:06:17.340 - 00:06:17.980] But other times, they don't.\n[00:06:20.440 - 00:06:23.780] to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant\n[00:06:23.780 - 00:06:25.220] for the sake of the big picture,\n[00:06:25.340 - 00:06:26.900] and that's when we have a conflict.\n[00:06:27.660 - 00:06:29.040] And for the procrastinator,\n[00:06:29.120 - 00:06:31.500] that conflict tends to end a certain way every time,\n[00:06:31.700 - 00:06:34.660] leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,\n[00:06:35.260 - 00:06:39.680] an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the make-sense circle.\n[00:06:39.840 - 00:06:41.460] I call it the dark playground.\n[00:06:44.980 - 00:06:46.980] Now, the dark playground is a place where you don't have to worry about\n[00:06:49.180 - 00:06:49.940] know very well.\n[00:06:50.540 - 00:06:52.440] It's where leisure activities happen\n[00:06:52.440 - 00:06:55.460] at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.\n[00:06:56.040 - 00:06:58.620] The fun you have in the dark playground isn't actually fun\n[00:06:58.620 - 00:07:00.260] because it's completely unearned,\n[00:07:00.260 - 00:07:03.820] and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred,\n[00:07:03.860 - 00:07:05.500] all those good procrastinator feelings.\n[00:07:06.280 - 00:07:09.600] And the question is, in this situation, with the monkey behind the wheel,\n[00:07:09.840 - 00:07:13.260] how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,\n[00:07:13.260 - 00:07:15.900] a less pleasant place, but where really important things\n[00:07:17.200 - 00:07:21.900] Well, it turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel,\n[00:07:22.080 - 00:07:24.880] someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him\n[00:07:25.480 - 00:07:26.340] in his darkest moments,\n[00:07:26.560 - 00:07:28.540] someone called the panic monster.\n[00:07:34.580 - 00:07:38.380] Now, the panic monster is dormant most of the time,\n[00:07:39.360 - 00:07:40.520] but he suddenly wakes up.\n[00:07:40.760 - 00:07:43.040] Any time a deadline gets too close\n[00:07:43.040 - 00:07:44.640] or there's danger of public embarrassment,\n[00:07:47.700 - 00:07:51.720] And importantly, he's the only thing that the monkey is terrified of.\n[00:07:51.920 - 00:07:55.700] Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,\n[00:07:56.320 - 00:07:59.900] because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago\n[00:07:59.900 - 00:08:01.420] and invited me to do a TED Talk.\n[00:08:06.700 - 00:08:08.600] Now, of course, I said,\n[00:08:08.660 - 00:08:12.400] yes, it's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.\n[00:08:23.880 - 00:08:27.080] but in the middle of all this excitement the rational decision maker seemed to have something\n[00:08:27.080 - 00:08:33.540] else in his mind he was saying are we clear on what we just accepted do we do we get what's\n[00:08:33.540 - 00:08:37.180] going to be now happening one day in the future we need to sit down and work on this right now\n[00:08:37.180 - 00:08:41.660] and the monkey said totally agree but also let's just open google earth and let's zoom into the\n[00:08:41.660 - 00:08:42.800] bottom of india like 200\n[00:08:43.660 - 00:08:45.300] and we're going to scroll up for two and a half hours\n[00:08:45.300 - 00:08:48.920] until we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for India.\n[00:08:54.860 - 00:08:56.400] So that's what we did that day.\n[00:09:00.420 - 00:09:04.200] As six months turned into four, and then two, and then one,\n[00:09:04.340 - 00:09:07.200] the people of TED decided to release the speakers.\n[00:09:07.420 - 00:09:08.760] And I opened up the website,\n[00:09:09.020 - 00:09:11.360] and there was my face, staring right back at me,\n[00:09:11.360 - 00:09:11.760] and\n[00:09:17.080 - 00:09:19.480] So the panic monster starts losing his mind,\n[00:09:19.680 - 00:09:22.060] and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.\n[00:09:27.180 - 00:09:29.820] And the monkey, who, remember, he's terrified of the panic monster,\n[00:09:29.900 - 00:09:30.900] boom, he's up the tree.\n[00:09:31.500 - 00:09:33.120] And finally, finally,\n[00:09:33.380 - 00:09:35.380] the rational decision-maker can take the wheel,\n[00:09:35.460 - 00:09:36.880] and I can start working on the talk.\n[00:09:36.880 - 00:09:40.780] Now, the panic monster explains all kinds of\n[00:09:43.140 - 00:09:45.080] like how someone like me could spend two weeks\n[00:09:45.080 - 00:09:48.560] unable to start the opening sentence of a paper,\n[00:09:49.440 - 00:09:52.100] and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic\n[00:09:52.100 - 00:09:54.760] to stay up all night and write eight pages.\n[00:09:56.120 - 00:09:59.360] And this entire situation with the three characters,\n[00:09:59.500 - 00:10:01.140] this is the procrastinator's system.\n[00:10:01.700 - 00:10:04.920] It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.\n[00:10:05.240 - 00:10:07.960] And this is what I decided to write about on the blog\n[00:10:08.480 - 00:10:09.280] just a couple years ago.\n[00:10:09.280 - 00:10:09.980] Now, I want to talk to you about this.\n[00:10:12.380 - 00:10:14.220] Literally thousands of emails came in\n[00:10:14.220 - 00:10:16.960] from all different kinds of people from all over the world,\n[00:10:16.980 - 00:10:18.280] doing all different kinds of things.\n[00:10:18.660 - 00:10:22.100] These were people who were nurses and bankers and painters and engineers\n[00:10:22.100 - 00:10:24.040] and lots and lots of PhD students.\n[00:10:26.380 - 00:10:28.340] And they were all writing, saying the same thing.\n[00:10:28.420 - 00:10:30.340] I have this problem, too.\n[00:10:30.800 - 00:10:33.920] But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post\n[00:10:34.480 - 00:10:36.060] and the heaviness of these emails.\n[00:10:36.060 - 00:10:38.980] These people were writing about themselves.\n[00:10:39.940 - 00:10:42.500] about what procrastination had done to their lives,\n[00:10:42.700 - 00:10:44.660] about what this monkey had done to them.\n[00:10:47.440 - 00:10:49.980] And I thought about this, and I said,\n[00:10:50.040 - 00:10:52.480] if the procrastinator system works, then what's going on?\n[00:10:52.720 - 00:10:54.480] Why are all these people in such a dark place?\n[00:10:54.660 - 00:10:58.520] Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.\n[00:10:59.760 - 00:11:01.780] Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,\n[00:11:01.860 - 00:11:03.540] they all have deadlines, and when there's deadlines,\n[00:11:03.740 - 00:11:07.680] the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term,\n[00:11:07.680 - 00:11:07.980] because...\n[00:11:09.400 - 00:11:11.140] But there's a second kind of procrastination\n[00:11:11.140 - 00:11:14.260] that happens in situations when there is no deadline.\n[00:11:14.560 - 00:11:16.940] So if you want to have a career where you want to be a self-starter,\n[00:11:17.080 - 00:11:19.300] something in the arts, something entrepreneurial,\n[00:11:19.600 - 00:11:21.480] there's no deadlines on those things at first\n[00:11:22.000 - 00:11:23.300] because nothing's happening at first,\n[00:11:23.360 - 00:11:25.180] not until you've gone out and done the hard work\n[00:11:25.180 - 00:11:26.920] to get some momentum, to get things going.\n[00:11:27.180 - 00:11:29.680] There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career\n[00:11:29.680 - 00:11:31.220] that don't involve any deadlines,\n[00:11:31.380 - 00:11:34.300] like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,\n[00:11:34.300 - 00:11:36.980] working on your relationship or getting a job.\n[00:11:39.220 - 00:11:42.220] Now, if the procrastinator's only mechanism\n[00:11:42.840 - 00:11:45.640] of doing these hard things is the panic monster,\n[00:11:45.700 - 00:11:48.100] that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations,\n[00:11:48.980 - 00:11:51.760] the panic monster doesn't show up, he has nothing to wake up for,\n[00:11:51.940 - 00:11:54.280] so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained,\n[00:11:54.360 - 00:11:56.040] they just extend outward forever.\n[00:11:57.560 - 00:11:59.980] And it's this long-term kind of procrastination\n[00:12:00.520 - 00:12:03.640] that's much less visible and much less talked about\n[00:12:03.640 - 00:12:05.980] than the funnier, short-term, deadline-based ones.\n[00:12:06.600 - 00:12:09.100] It's usually suffered quietly and privately,\n[00:12:10.460 - 00:12:14.860] and it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness and regrets.\n[00:12:16.220 - 00:12:19.380] And I thought, that's why these people are emailing,\n[00:12:19.400 - 00:12:21.200] and that's why they're in such a bad place.\n[00:12:21.540 - 00:12:24.380] It's not that they're cramming for some project.\n[00:12:24.660 - 00:12:27.840] It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,\n[00:12:27.860 - 00:12:29.700] at times, in their own lives.\n[00:12:30.440 - 00:12:33.380] The frustration was not that they couldn't achieve their dreams,\n[00:12:33.380 - 00:12:34.440] it's that they weren't even able\n[00:12:36.380 - 00:12:40.580] So I read these emails, and I had a little bit of an epiphany\n[00:12:41.980 - 00:12:45.020] that I don't think non-procrastinators exist.\n[00:12:45.680 - 00:12:48.660] That's right, I think all of you are procrastinators.\n[00:12:49.540 - 00:12:52.620] Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us,\n[00:12:54.340 - 00:12:57.300] and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines.\n[00:12:57.700 - 00:13:02.120] But remember, the monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there.\n[00:13:03.180 - 00:13:03.980] Now, I want to show you one example.\n[00:13:04.880 - 00:13:07.280] I call this a life calendar.\n[00:13:08.020 - 00:13:12.180] That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.\n[00:13:13.060 - 00:13:14.600] That's not that many boxes,\n[00:13:14.680 - 00:13:17.640] especially since we've already used a bunch of those.\n[00:13:18.140 - 00:13:23.320] So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.\n[00:13:24.480 - 00:13:27.620] And we need to think about what we're really procrastinating on,\n[00:13:27.680 - 00:13:31.120] because everyone is procrastinating on something in life.\n[00:13:31.120 - 00:13:32.980] We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on.\n[00:13:37.120 - 00:13:39.500] That's a job for all of us.\n[00:13:40.780 - 00:13:42.400] And because there's not that many boxes on there,\n[00:13:42.460 - 00:13:44.600] it's a job that should probably start today.\n[00:13:45.000 - 00:13:48.120] Well, maybe not today, but ...\n[00:13:49.480 - 00:13:52.200] You know, sometime soon.\n[00:13:53.020 - 00:13:53.860] Thank you.\n[00:13:54.660 - 00:13:55.600] Thank you.\n[00:14:01.000 - 00:14:02.980] Thank you.",
